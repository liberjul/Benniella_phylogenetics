### Benniella + Environmental Sequences

Note: After UNITE database search, a limited set of taxa were determined to fall within the Benniella clade and were added to the SSU-LSU alignment.

ITSx was then used to pull out individual regions, which were aligned separately then concatenated.

ModelTest-NG was used to assess the best nucleotide substitution models for each region.


### Benniella multi-locus trees

Using the loci RPB1, EF1a, Xanthine Dehydrogenase (1870, from Linnemannia elongata AG77 gene numbers), in addition to SSU, ITS1, 5.8S, ITS2, and LSU loci, phylogenetic trees were inferred.

Each locus was independently aligned, then concatenated, then codon positions were used for partition for protein-coding genes. ModelTest-NG was used to assess substitution models.

Trees were inferred with RAxML-NG (with the suggested substitution models by AIC score) or Mr. Bayes with the supplied partition.
